# computer-programming-I
A dump of assignments and labs from my Computer Programming I (CS171) class.

Everything and anything that I made during Computer Programming I. All code was written in C++ on Microsoft Visual Studio.
Most assignments will have detailed descriptions about the programs, the labs on the other hand may not.
