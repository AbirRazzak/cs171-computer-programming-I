LUNAR LANDER INSTRUCTION 

You are landing on the moon and have taken over manua 
control 1000 feet above a good landing spot.  You have  
downward velocity of 50 feet/sec.  150 units of fuel remain 

Here are the rules that govern your APOLLO space-craft 
 (1) After each second, the height, velocity, and remainin 
     fuel will be reported via DIGBY, your on-board computer 
 (2) After each report, enter the number of units of fuel yo 
     wish to burn during the next second.  Each unit of fue 
     will slow your descent by 1 foot/sec 
 (3) The maximum thrust of your engine is 30 feet/sec/sec o 
     0 units of fuel per second 
 (4) When you contact the lunar surface, your descent engin 
     will automatically shut down and you will be given a 
     report of your landing speed and remaining fuel 
 (5) If you run out of fuel, you will no longer be prompte 
     to enter the number of units to burn each second.  You 
     second by second reports will continue until you contac 
     the lunar surface
